\subsection{Sybil groups}
Our system identified the following Sybil groups.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l c p{4cm}}
\textbf{Group ID} & \textbf{\# of relays} & \textbf{Attack} \\
\hline
Sigaint & 70 & Transparent onion URL rewriting. \\
\ldots & \ldots & \ldots \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Sybil groups identified by our system.}
\label{bar}
\end{table}

\subsection{Other anomalies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Some events with unexpectedly high network churn.  Generally, churn
		is not problematic.  It can be problematic, however, for guard relays,
		if they change their IP addresses.

	\item Several relays changed their fingerprint an unusually high amount of
		times.  Cause often misconfiguration, but in some cases likely attacks
		on Tor's DHT.
\end{itemize}
