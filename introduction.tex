\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Massive amount of data archived by Tor.  Nobody looked at it before.

	\item We have a good understanding of how relays should behave, and we mine
		archived data for anomalies.

	\item Example anomalies are \emph{1)} unexpectedly high churn rates,
		\emph{2)} relays that change their fingerprint a lot, and \emph{3)}
		unidentified Sybil groups.

	\item Our work improves our understanding of the Tor network, which guides
		future design decisions.

	\item We are also able to uncover Sybil attacks.

	\item We can analyse past data, but also run our code on new data as it
		arrives.
\end{itemize}

The rest of this paper is structured as follows.  We begin by discussing
related work in Section~\ref{sec:related_work}.  Section~\ref{sec:design}
presents the design of our analysis tools, which is then followed by
experimental results in Section~\ref{sec:results}.  We discuss our results in
Section~\ref{sec:discussion} and conclude the paper in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
