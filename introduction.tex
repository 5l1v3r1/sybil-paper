\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
In a Sybil attack, an attacker controls many virtual identities to obtain
disproportionately large influence in a network.  These attacks take many
shapes, such as sockpuppets hijacking online discourse~\cite{Thomas2012a}; the
manipulation of BitTorrent's distributed hash table~\cite{Wang2012a}; and, most
relevant to our work, relays in the Tor network that seek to deanonymize
users~\cite{cmucert}.  In addition to coining the term ``Sybil,''\footnote{The
term is a reference to a book in which the female protagonist, Sybil, suffers
from dissociative identity disorder~\cite{Schreiber1973}.} Douceur showed that
practical Sybil defenses are challenging, arguing that Sybil attacks are always
possible without a central authority~\cite{Douceur2002a}.  In this work, we
focus on Sybils in Tor---relays that are controlled by a single operator.  But
what harm can Sybils do?

The effectiveness of many attacks on Tor depends on how large a fraction of the
network's traffic---called the consensus weight---an attacker can observe.  As
the attacker's consensus weight grows, the following attacks become easier.

\begin{description}[noitemsep]
	\item[Exit traffic tampering:] When leaving the Tor network, a Tor user's
		traffic traverses exit relays, the last hop in a Tor circuit.
		Controlling exit relays, an attacker can eavesdrop on traffic to collect
		unencrypted credentials, break into TLS-protected connections, or inject
		malicious content~\cite[\S~5.2]{Winter2014a}.
	\item[Website fingerprinting:] Tor's encryption prevents guard relays (the
		first hop in a Tor circuit) from learning their user's online activity.
		Ignoring the encrypted payload, an attacker can still take advantage of
		flow information such as packet lengths and timings to infer what
		websites Tor users are visiting~\cite{Juarez2014a}.
	\item[Bridge address harvesting:] Users behind censorship systems use
		private Tor relays---typically called bridges---as hidden stepping
		stones into the Tor network.  It is important that censors cannot obtain
		all bridge addresses, which is why The Tor Project rate-limits bridge
		distribution.  However, an attacker can harvest bridge addresses by
		running a middle relay and looking for incoming connections that do not
		originate from any of the publicly known guard
		relays~\cite[\S~3.4]{Ling2015b}.
	\item[End-to-end correlation:] By running both entry guards and exit relays,
		an attacker can use timing analysis to link a Tor user's identity to her
		activity, e.g., learn that \emph{Alice} is visiting \emph{Facebook}.
		For this attack to work, an attacker must run at least two Tor relays,
		or be able to eavesdrop on at least two networks~\cite{Johnson2013a}.
\end{description}

Configuring a relay to forward more traffic allows an attacker to increase her
consensus weight.  However, the capacity of a single relay is limited by its
link bandwidth and, because of the computational cost of cryptography, by CPU.
Ultimately, increasing consensus weight requires an adversary to add relays to
the network; we call these additional relays Sybils.

In addition to the above attacks, an adversary needs Sybil relays to manipulate
onion services, which are TCP servers whose IP address is hidden by Tor.  In the
current onion service protocol, six Sybil relays are sufficient to take offline
an onion service because of a weakness in the design of the distributed hash
table (DHT) that powers onion services~\cite[\S~V]{Biryukov2013a}.  Finally,
instead of being a direct means to an end, Sybil relays can be a \emph{side
effect} of another issue.  In Section~\ref{sec:sybil_groups}, we provide
evidence for what appears to be botnets whose zombies are running Tor relays,
perhaps because of a misguided attempt to help the Tor network grow.

Motivated by the lack of practical Sybil detection tools, we design and
implement heuristics, leveraging our observations that Sybils (\emph{i})
frequently go online and offline simultaneously, (\emph{ii}) share similarities
in their configuration, and (\emph{iii}) may change their identity
fingerprint---a relay's fingerprint is the hash over its public
key---frequently, to manipulate Tor's DHT.  Three of our four heuristics are
automated and designed to run autonomously while one assists in manual analysis
by ranking what relays in the network are the most similar to a given reference
relay.  Our evaluation suggests that our heuristics differ in their
effectiveness; one method detected only a small number of incidents, but some of
them no other method could detect.  Other heuristics produced a large number of
results, and seem well-suited to spot the ``low hanging fruit.'' We implemented
these heuristics in a tool, \sys, which we subsequently used to analyze 100 GiB
worth of archived network data, consisting of millions of files, and dating back
to 2007.  Finally, we characterize the Sybil groups we discovered.  To sum up,
we make the following key contributions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We design and implement \sys, a tool to analyze past and future Tor
		network data.  While we designed it specifically for the use in Tor, our
		techniques are general in nature and can easily be applied to other
		distributed systems such as I2P~\cite{i2p}.
	\item We characterize Sybil groups and publish our findings as datasets to
		stimulate future research.\footnote{The datasets are available online
		at\\\url{https://nymity.ch/sybilhunting/}.} We find that Sybils run MitM
		attacks, DoS attacks, and are used for research projects.
\end{itemize}

The rest of this paper is structured as follows.  We begin by discussing related
work in Section~\ref{sec:related_work} and give some background on Tor in
Section~\ref{sec:background}.  Section~\ref{sec:design} presents the design of
our analysis tools, which is then followed by experimental results in
Section~\ref{sec:results}.  We discuss our results in
Section~\ref{sec:discussion} and conclude the paper in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
