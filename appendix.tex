Figure~\ref{fig:default-sybils-uptime} shows the uptime matrix for the
``default'' Sybil cluster for October 2015.  Matrix rows represent consensuses and
columns represent relays.  As a result, a single pixel shows if a given relays
was online (black pixel) or offline (white pixel) in a given consensus.  The
matrix shows that many relays exhibit a diurnal uptime pattern.
