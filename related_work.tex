The concept of a Sybil attack was coined by Douceur in 2002~\cite{Douceur2002a}.
Douceur formally showed that without a central verification authority,
Sybil attacks are always possible.  The attack can be mitigated, however, by
making assumptions on the attacker's available resources.  These assumptions
became the focus of subsequent work.  Researchers tried to identify resources
that are difficult to scale for attackers.

Related to the Tor network, Margolin and Levine~\cite{Margolin2008a} evaluated
a recurring fee onion routing protocol in which network participants pay a
small amount of money for circuit creation.  This should make it prohibitively
expensive to run Sybil attacks.

Bauer's work caused Tor to limit number of relays per IP
address~\cite{Bauer2007a}.
