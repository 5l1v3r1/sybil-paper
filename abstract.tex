{
Being a volunteer-run, distributed anonymity network, Tor is vulnerable to Sybil
attacks.  Sybil relays can increase exposure to relayed traffic and manipulate
Tor's distributed hash table.  Until now, little was known about real-world
Sybils in the Tor network, and we lack comprehensive tools to find and analyze
Sybil attacks.
%
We develop a system that can detect Sybil relays based on their appearance and
behavior.  Our system can analyze past and future Tor network data for Sybil
attacks.  We discuss the design of our system, and characterize Sybil groups we
discovered.
%
Our work reveals how attackers operate, what they are motivated by, and provides
practical tools to analyze and characterize Tor relays.
