\subsection*{Abstract}
Being a volunteer-run, distributed anonymity network, Tor is vulnerable to Sybil
attacks.  Little is known about real-world Sybils in the Tor network, and we
lack practical tools and methods to expose Sybil attacks.
%
In this work, we develop \sys, the first system for detecting Sybil relays based
on their \emph{appearance}, such as configuration; and \emph{behavior}, such as
uptime sequences.  We used \sys's diverse analysis techniques to analyze nine
years of archived Tor network data, providing us with new insights into the
operation of real-world attackers.  Our findings include diverse incidents,
ranging from botnets, to academic research, and relays that engage in Bitcoin
transaction hijacking.
%
Our work shows that existing Sybil defenses do not apply to Tor, it delivers
insight into real-world attackers, and provides practical tools to expose and
characterize Tor relays, making the network safer for its users.
