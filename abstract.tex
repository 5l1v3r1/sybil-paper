\subsection*{Abstract}
Being a volunteer-run, distributed anonymity network, Tor is vulnerable to Sybil
attacks that can increase the attacker's exposure to relayed traffic and
manipulate Tor's distributed hash table.  Little is known about real-world
Sybils in the Tor network, and we lack practical tools and methods to expose
Sybil attacks.
%
In this work, we develop sybilhunter, the first system for detecting Sybil
relays based on their \emph{appearance}, such as configuration; and
\emph{behavior}, such as uptime sequences.  Our system can analyze past and
future Tor network data for Sybil attacks.  We discuss the design of our system
and characterize the Sybil groups we discovered, which includes botnets and
relays that engage in Bitcoin theft.
%
Our work shows how existing Sybil defenses do not apply to Tor, it reveals how
attackers operate, and provides practical tools to analyze and characterize Tor
relays.
