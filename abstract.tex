{
Being a volunteer-run, distributed anonymity network, Tor is vulnerable to Sybil
attacks that can increase the attacker's exposure to relayed traffic and
manipulate Tor's distributed hash table.  Little is known about real-world
Sybils in the Tor network, and we lack practical tools and methods to expose
Sybil attacks.
%
We develop sybilhunter, the first system for detecting Sybil relays based on
their appearance and behavior.  Our system can analyze past and future Tor
network data for Sybil attacks.  We discuss the design of our system and
characterize Sybil groups we discovered.
%
Our work shows how existing Sybil defenses don't apply to Tor, it reveals how
attackers operate, and provides practical tools to analyze and characterize Tor
relays.
