{Being a volunteer-run, distributed system, Tor is vulnerable to Sybil attacks.
Sybils can be used to increase exposure to relayed traffic and to manipulate
Tor's distributed hash table.
%
We develop a Sybil detection system that can analyze past and future data for
Sybil attacks.  We discuss the design of our system, and characterize Sybil
groups we discovered.
%
Our work shows how attackers work, and can provide some protection in the
future.}
