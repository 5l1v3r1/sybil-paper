\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we presented novel techniques to discover Sybils in the Tor
network.  We first invested significant engineering effort into the development
of sybilhunter, a free command line tool that implements our analysis
techniques.

Equipped with this new tool, we set out to analyze The Tor Project's network
data---archived as well as online data---for signs of Sybil relays.  We
uncovered several Sybil groups and gained new insight into real-world Sybil
attacks.  We found that (\emph{i}) Sybil relays frequently look alike in their
appearance and behavior, (\emph{ii}) Sybil-running attackers differ greatly in
their technical sophistication, and (\emph{iii}) our techniques not only perform
well at spotting Sybils, but turn out to be a handy analytical tool to monitor
and understand the Tor network.

Given the lack of a central identity-verifying authority, it is always possible
for a well-executed Sybil attack to stay under our radar, but we found that a
simple set of tools and techniques can go a long way towards finding malicious
Sybils, thus making the Tor network more secure and trustworthy for its users.
