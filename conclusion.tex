\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We presented \sys, a novel system that uses diverse analysis techniques to
expose Sybils in the Tor network.  Equipped with this tool, we set out to
analyze nine years of The Tor Project's archived network data.  We discovered
numerous Sybil groups, twenty of which we present in this work.  By analyzing
these Sybil groups \sys discovered, we found that (\emph{i}) Sybil relays are
frequently configured very similarly, and join and leave the network
simultaneously; (\emph{ii}) attackers differ greatly in their technical
sophistication; and (\emph{iii}) our techniques are not only useful for spotting
Sybils, but turn out to be a handy analytics tool to monitor and better
understand the Tor network.  Given the lack of a central identity-verifying
authority, it is always possible for well-executed Sybil attacks to stay under
our radar, but we found that a complementary set of techniques can go a long way
towards finding malicious Sybils, making the Tor network more secure and
trustworthy for its users.
